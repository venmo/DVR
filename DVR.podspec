DVR is a simple Swift framework for making fake NSURLSession requests for iOS, watchOS, and OS X based on VCR.

Easy dependency injection is the main design goal. The API is the same as NSURLSession.

DVR.Session is a subclass of NSURLSession so you can use it as a drop in replacement anywhere. (Currently only data tasks are supported.)
